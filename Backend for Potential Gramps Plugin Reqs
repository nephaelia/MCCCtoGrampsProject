Program would need to:
- recognize:
    - timestamps
    - last names
    - first names
    - specific strings:
        - age up events ex: 'Age.YOUNGADULT'
        - death events ex: 'Deathtype.Electrocution'
- send, via some api, for each line read:
    - last name: if exists, skip; if not, add to db and continue
    - first name: if exists for given last name, skip; if not, add to db and continue
    - strings: if exists for given first and last name, add with a note
    - timestamp from line
    - timestamp information was sent

Need to figure out how Gramps formats its SQL db tables etc.
https://www.gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Gramps_SQL_Database
might look into exporting one of my existing family trees to test this

will test this backend js for my own use with my own API, I know Gramps has its own API it asks any collaborators to use for official 
plugins
(would be interested in doing this eventually- this is a super crazy niche problem I'm solving but for anyone who needs it solved
it would be HUGE)

Another thing for the future is to get this to work off of actual game files rather than relying on MCCC (which I don't have access to 
the code for), potentially creating my own mod to pull the information from the game files into a format more ideal for this use
    - would be good to avoid conflicting with MCCC since I don't want to recreate the entire mod, and it's so widely used. Not sure how
    this works but will need to look into it if/when I'm working on this
